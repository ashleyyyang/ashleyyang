                <p>
                    To get a better understanding of the language-learning problem space, I surveyed six university students with non-leading open-response questions.</p>

                    <p>
                    From these numbers, the students value accessibility to low-cost resources and verbal communication. 
                    The students’ qualitative answers show the reason they started learning a language in the first place: 
                    their cultural ties to the language. All of the students were first motivated to learn a language to 
                    either consume more media from that culture, connect with their heritage, or adapt to a new country. </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    I used this information to create two personas to help guide me through the design journey. </p>

                    <h2><strong>Problems</strong></h2>
                    <p>Based on my primary research, students face three main problems when learning or retaining a language on their own:</p>
                    <blockquote class="stacked">

                    <strong><p>
                    1. They’re busy. <br />
                    2. It’s hard to stay motivated. <br />
                    3. Lack of access to feedback. </strong></p></blockquote>

                    <p>I turned these three problems into necessary functions and created a morphological chart 
                    to generate possible solutions and determine the combination that would best solve the users’ 
                    problems based on feasibility and effectiveness. </p>

                    <h4>How is Cultura different?</h4>
                    <p>
                    Cultura differentiates itself from other products in the digital 
                    language-learning sector in its focus on the WHY of learning a language: 
                    connecting to a culture through language and verbal communication. Products like Duolingo and Conjuguemos are amazing at providing active vocabulary and 
                    grammar practice, and Cultura can supplement those resources by fitting into the 
                    users’ existing lifestyle through its listening aspect, minimizing the time a person 
                    needs to set out of their day to learn. </p>

                    <a name="first"></a>
                    <h2><strong>First Iteration</strong></h2>
                   <p>Two success metrics that would indicate how well the design 
                   solves the users’ problems are:</p>

                   <blockquote class="stacked">
                       <p>
                    <strong>1. Task completion rate</strong>. <br />
                    The task completion rate 
                    suggests the clarity of the design. I set the success threshold to <strong>92%</strong>
                    to be in <a href="https://measuringu.com/task-completion/" target="_blank">the top quartile</a>; anything 
                    lower than 92% means that there may be significant usability problems.<br /> <br />
                    <strong>2. Net Promoter Score</strong>. <br />
                    This metric is a bit more tricky 
                    since it depends on the first impression of the product, but it does provide a 
                    quantitative measure to determine users' opinions of the product. 
                    I set my benchmark NPS to be 0, with an average score of 8. Although 9 would be 
                    ideal, I chose 8 to be a buffer.</p></blockquote>

                </p>

                    <p>After conducting 3 usability testing sessions, I compared my 
                    findings to the success metrics. <strong>The results didn’t quite hit the mark:</strong></p>

                    <blockquote class="stacked">
                            <p>
                         <strong>1. Task completion rate</strong>. <br />Out of the 15 tasks, 13 were 
                         completed correctly. This result of <strong>87% did not meet the benchmark of 92%</strong>, 
                         but since it was just one task from reaching the goal, I knew there were some 
                         minor issues with design clarity and meeting users’ expectations that I should address in the next iteration.<br /> <br />
                         <strong>2. Net Promoter Score</strong>.<br />
                          This result <strong>just met the benchmark with an NPS of 0 and an average rating of 8</strong>. 
                         However, this was not a strong indicator because although I reminded the users that their answers wouldn’t hurt my feelings 
                         in any way, the users may have still felt 
                         uncomfortable letting me know their true thoughts. It would also be 
                         <a href="http://static.duolingo.com/s3/DuolingoReport_Final.pdf" target="_blank">difficult to predict</a> if the users 
                         would continue using this product from this metric alone, 
                         so I would likely use the NPS in a non-personal setting or after the user has used 
                         a product for a longer time.</p></blockquote>

                        <p>
                         I also gathered my top four insights: </p>

                         <blockquote class="stacked">
                                <p>
                         <strong>1. The app functionality is unclear upfront.</strong><br />
                         - 3/3 users were unsure of what to expect of the app.<br />
                         - “I'm interested in a topic but I’m unsure of what it will be when you click on it.”<br /><br />
                         <strong>2. The app is not beginner-friendly.</strong><br />
                         - 3/3 users thought the app would be difficult to use for beginners.<br />
                         - “Titles being in Korean scares me a bit; I don’t know what it means.”<br />
                         - “Personally I’m not too sure I would use it because I don’t know enough to answer a question.”<br /><br />
                         <strong>3. Lack of trust.</strong><br />
                         - 2/3 users found it difficult to trust feedback from random users.<br />
                         - “People evaluating are other users. I don’t know how much they know about the other 
                         language...if I’m putting in a lot of effort, it would be nice to have confidence in the person grading it.”<br /><br />
                         <strong>4. Episodes are too long.</strong><br />
                         - 3/3 users found the number of episodes to be too long, especially in the context of their commutes (15-30 min).</p></blockquote>
                         
                         <p>
                         These insights showed that the design did not meet users' expectations. 
                         Next time, running through a quick heuristic evaluation before usability 
                         testing will help me avoid making the same mistakes. The design also does not 
                         consider ALL users — I realized from this session that the biggest differentiating 
                         factor between users was not the specific reasons for learning a language but the users' 
                         level of expertise in the languages. So, I made another persona to represent language 
                         beginners and keep them in mind while doing the second iteration. </p>
                         
                         <a name="second"></a>
                         <h2><strong>Second Iteration</strong></h2>

                         
                         <p>
        I made several changes to address the main issues:</p>


        <h4>1. The app functionality is unclear upfront</h4>
        <p>
        The users expected an explanation of the app at the beginning or did not fully 
        understand the explanation on the sign up page, so I wanted to make it more clear 
        that the user would be able to listen to listen to episodes in a foreign language 
        and receive feedback on their recorded answers. Since I wanted to make the functionality 
        intuitive, I included a diagnostic test that mimics how the app works to give users a clear 
        expectation of how to use the app. The diagnostic test would also excite the user as they anticipate a result.</p>
        <img src="img/cultura-login.png"><br />


        <h4>2. The app is not beginner-friendly</h4>
        <p>This point ties in with the first issue. I specified the unique experience each user type (beginner, intermediate, advanced) 
        would have and how Cultura would accomodate for their levels. If the user knows that they are
        a complete beginner, they can skip the test.</p>
        <img src="img/cultura-quiz.jpg"><br />


        <h4>3. Lack of trust</h4>
        <p>
        Instead of having feedback from users, the feedback would now be from paid Cultura language experts.</p>
        <img src="img/cultura-feedback.jpg"><br />


        <h4>4. Episodes are too long</h4>
        <p>
        I decreased the length of episodes to around 15 minutes to accommodate for 
        the amount of time each user was expected to spend in one sitting on the app.</p>        
        <img src="img/cultura-ep.jpg"><br />

        <br />

        <br />

        <a name="business"></a>
        <h2><strong>Let’s get down to business</strong></h2>
        <p>
        Throughout the design process, I thought about how this product would function with business requirements. 
        How would this app fund itself? Because one main pillar of the app is accessibility, I did not 
        want this app to be paid. Implementing ads in users' target languages would provide some learning 
        value to them while funding the product, making this usually intrusive advertisement component more pleasant. I would 
        have to research more about the business aspect of products to determine if this method is feasible.</p> <br />

        <a name="next"></a>
        <h2><strong>Next steps</strong></h2>

        <p>
        The second round of usability testing is in progress.<br />

        Testing the success of the app would be difficult without creating a working prototype 
        because it is meant to be used over time. If I were to develop the app, these are some 
        KPIs I would use to gauge the product’s success, determined by engagement:</p>

        <blockquote class="stacked">
                <p>
        <strong>1. Episode completion rate:</strong> 35%, based on 
        <a href="https://rainnews.com/the-download-on-podcasts-podcast-completion-rate-its-still-about-length/" target="_blank">the average length</a> of Cultura episodes (around 15 minutes)
        <br /><br />
        <strong>2. Listen frequency: </strong>7 episodes per week, 
        <a href="https://www.podcastinsights.com/podcast-statistics/" target="_blank">based on the US average</a>
        <br /><br />
        <strong>3. Feedback-to-listen ratio:</strong> This data would be important to determine how useful the feedback feature is.
        Because I couldn’t find a benchmark for this, I would likely do some testing to determine this number.<br />
