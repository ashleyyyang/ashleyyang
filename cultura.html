                <h2><strong>Research</strong></h2>

                <p>
                    To get a better understanding of the language-learning problem space, I surveyed six university students with non-leading open-response questions:</p>
                    <p><strong>
                            1. How did you learn a language? <br />
                            2. Which resources were helpful and why?<br />
                            3. What do you wish you had during the process?<br />
                            4. What was the hardest part?</strong>
                            </p>

                        <h5><strong>FINDINGS:</strong></h5>

                            1. Students value free resources and verbal communication. <br />
                            2. Students started learning a language in the first place because of  
                            their cultural ties to the language.</strong>
                            </p></blockquote>
                    <!--
                    <p>
                    The results showed that the students value free resources and verbal communication. 
                    I was also able to determine the reason they started learning a language in the first place: 
                    their cultural ties to the language. All of the students were first motivated to learn a language to 
                    either consume more media from that culture, connect with their heritage, or adapt to a new country. </p>    -->

                    <h2><strong>Problems</strong></h2>
                    <p>Based on my primary research, students face three main challenges when learning or retaining a language on their own:</p>
                    <blockquote class="shadow-quote">

                    
                            <h5><strong>PROBLEMS:</strong></h5>
                            <strong><p> 1. It’s difficult to fit into their schedules. <br />
                    2. They lose motivation quickly. <br />
                    3. They don’t have access to feedback. </strong></p></blockquote>

                    <p>I turned these three problems into functions and created a morphological chart 
                    to determine the most feasible and effective combination.</p>

                   <p>I chose two success metrics that would validate the design:</p>

                   <blockquote class="shadow-quote">
                        <h5><strong>SUCCESS METRICS:</strong></h5>
                       <p>
                    <strong>1. Task completion rate</strong>. <br />
                    The task completion rate 
                    suggests the clarity of the design. I set the success threshold to <strong>92%</strong>
                    to be in <a href="https://measuringu.com/task-completion/" target="_blank">the top quartile</a>; anything 
                    lower than 92% means that there may be significant usability problems.<br /> <br />
                    <strong>2. Net Promoter Score</strong>. <br />
                    This metric is a bit more tricky 
                    since the score will be based solely on the users' first impressions, but it does provide a 
                    quantitative measure to determine their opinions of the product. 
                    I set my benchmark NPS to be 0. </p></blockquote>



                    <p>After conducting 3 usability testing sessions, I compared my 
                    findings to the success metrics. <strong>The results didn’t quite hit the mark:</strong></p>

                    <blockquote class="shadow-quote">
                            <h5><strong>SUCCESS METRIC RESULTS:</strong></h5>
                            
                        <p>
                        <strong>1. Task completion rate.</strong> <br />
                         Out of the 15 tasks, 13 were 
                         completed correctly. This result of <strong>87% did not meet the benchmark of 92%</strong>, 
                         but since it was just one task from reaching the goal, I knew there were some 
                         minor issues with design clarity.<br /> <br />
                         <strong>2. Net Promoter Score.</strong><br />
                            This result <strong>just met the benchmark with an NPS of 0</strong>. 
                         However, this is not a strong indicator because I realized that the users may have felt 
                         uncomfortable letting me know their true thoughts. It would also be 
                         <a href="http://static.duolingo.com/s3/DuolingoReport_Final.pdf" target="_blank">difficult to predict</a> if the users 
                         would continue using this product from this metric alone, 
                         so I would likely use the NPS in an anonymous setting or after the user has used 
                         a product for a longer time.</p></blockquote>

                        <p>
                         I also gathered common feedback: </p>

                         <blockquote class="shadow-quote">
                                <h5><strong>TOP 4 INSIGHTS:</strong></h5>
                                <p>
                         <strong>1. The app functionality is unclear upfront.</strong><br />
                         3/3 users were unsure of what to expect of the app.<br />
                         “I’m interested in a topic but I’m unsure of what it will be when you click on it.”<br /><br />
                         <strong>2. The app is not beginner-friendly.</strong><br />
                         3/3 users thought the app would be difficult to use for beginners.<br />
                         “Titles being in Korean scares me a bit; I don’t know what it means.”<br />
                         “Personally I’m not too sure I would use it because I don’t know enough to answer a question.”<br /><br />
                         <strong>3. Lack of trust.</strong><br />
                         2/3 users found it difficult to trust feedback from random users.<br />
                         “People evaluating are other users. I don’t know how much they know about the other 
                         language...if I’m putting in a lot of effort, it would be nice to have confidence in the person grading it.”<br /><br />
                         <strong>4. Episodes are too long.</strong><br />
                         3/3 users found the number of episodes to be too long, especially in the context of their commutes (15-30 min).</p></blockquote>
                         
                         <p>
                         These insights showed that the design did not meet users’ expectations. 
                         Next time, running through a quick heuristic evaluation before usability 
                         testing will help me avoid making the same mistakes. The design also does not 
                         consider ALL users — the biggest differentiating 
                         factor between users was not the specific reasons for learning a language but the users’ 
                         level of expertise in the languages, which I did not account for. </p>

                    I made several changes to address the main issues:</p>

                    <div class="py-3">
                    <h4>1. The app functionality is unclear upfront</h4>
                    <p>
                    The users expected an explanation of the app at the beginning or did not fully 
                    understand the explanation on the sign up page, so I wanted to make it more clear 
                    that the user would be able to listen to listen to episodes in a foreign language 
                    and receive feedback on their recorded answers. Since I wanted to make the functionality 
                    intuitive, I included a diagnostic quiz that mimics how the app works to give users a clear 
                    expectation of how to use the app. The diagnostic quiz would also excite the user as they anticipate a result.</p>

                    <div class="py-3">
                    <h4>2. The app is not beginner-friendly</h4>
                    <p>This point ties in with the first issue. I specified the unique experience for each user type (beginner, intermediate, advanced) 
                    and how Cultura would accomodate for their levels. If the user knows that they are
                    a complete beginner, they can skip the test.</p>

                    <h2><strong>Business Considerations</strong></h2>
                    <p>
                    Throughout the design process, I thought about how this product would function with business requirements. 
                    How would this app fund itself? Because one main pillar of the app is accessibility, I did not 
                    want this app to be paid. Implementing ads in users’ target languages would provide some learning 
                    value to them while funding the product, making this usually intrusive advertisement component more pleasant. 
                    However, could these ads be implemented if the user downloads all their lessons? I would 
                    have to research more about the business aspect of products to determine if this method is feasible.</p> <br />

                    <h2><strong>Ethical Considerations</strong></h2>
                    <p>
                    Are there any dangers in the way I designed this language learning experience? 
                    Something that occurred to me as I was finishing up the second iteration is the behaviors that Cultura might encourage. If someone started learning a language because they were interested in a specific aspect 
                    of a culture, would Cultura feed their interest and lead to a skewed view of that 
                    culture and its people? Or would the benefits of language-learning 
                    outweigh the cons significantly?
                    Considering the entire user/app relationship 
                    during the beginning of the design process would have presented these possible long-term effects earlier on.</p> <br />

                    <p>
                    The second round of usability testing is in progress.</p>
                    <p>

                    Testing the success of the app would be difficult without creating a working prototype 
                    because it is meant to be used over time. If I were to develop the app, these are some 
                    KPIs I would use to gauge the product’s success, determined by engagement:</p>

                            <h5><strong>KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS:</strong></h5>
                            <p>
                    <strong>1. Episode completion rate:</strong> 35%, based on 
                    <a href="https://rainnews.com/the-download-on-podcasts-podcast-completion-rate-its-still-about-length/" target="_blank">the average length</a> of Cultura episodes (around 15 minutes)
                    <br /><br />
                    <strong>2. Listen frequency: </strong>7 episodes per week, 
                    <a href="https://www.podcastinsights.com/podcast-statistics/" target="_blank">based on the US average</a>
                    <br /><br />
                    <strong>3. Feedback-to-listen ratio:</strong> This data would be important to determine how useful the feedback feature is.
                    Because I couldn’t find a benchmark for this, I would likely do some testing to determine this number.<br />
                    </p></blockquote>

                    <p>After usability testing, I would implement those findings as well as the business and ethical considerations.</p>

                    <p>
                    The idea to design a new language-learning experience originally popped into my head during a 
                conversation with a friend. From that conversation to a high-fidelity prototype, this project 
                challenged me to do more than practice UI principles and the 
                design process:</p> 

                <blockquote class="shadow-quote">
                        <h5><strong>TAKEAWAYS:</strong></h5>

                    <p><strong>1. Consider business and ethics early on.</strong> Business and ethics are not separate from design! 
                        They should be considered at the beginning of 
                        the design process, since both impact the users.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>2. Get more numbers.</strong> Even though I depended on metrics to validate my designs during usability 
                        testing, I still found myself unsure of the results. This uncertainty came from one of my constraints—the small 
                        sample size I gathered from my preliminary research. Having more data to analyze next time will give 
                        me more confidence that the design is meeting users' needs in the right way.
                    </p>
