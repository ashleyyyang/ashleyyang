                        <h4>driver/center console displays</h4>
                        <p>I am currently leading the user experience design for the dashboard of the solar car. I keep two goals in mind while designing. 
                                The overall goal for the solar race car is to be as efficient yet consumer-friendly as possible. 
                                The goal for the interior design is to support a driving experience that 
                                is safe, intuitive, and comfortable for drivers and passengers of the car. Because this project is in progress, this page is not yet complete and contains my work and thought processes so far!
                            </p>
        
        
                        
                            
                        <!--Purpose and constraints-->
        
        
                            <a name="#"></a>
                            <h2>THE PROCESS (SO FAR)</h2>
                                <h3>What’s involved?</h3>
                                <p>Before designing anything, the first step was to know what was necessary for the interior following American Solar Challenge regulations. To make sure we included all the components, 
                                    we asked about the experiences of drivers and passengers of our previous solar car, MSXII, and used sensory inputs/outputs as a guide to create a morphological chart. 
                                    The chart, divided into subsystems and broken down into specific functions, was used to brainstorm all  possible means of satisfying the functions.
                                    We narrowed the options to 1-2 for each function after analyzing different combinations and eliminating unviable choices.
                                </p>
         
                                <figure>
                                        <img src="img/ms_v3_morph.png">

                                            Section of V3 of the morphological chart.

                                     </figure>
        
                                     <p>After narrowing down some solutions, I grouped the components into sections to see 
                                         how they would work together. Sketching and discussing some of these ideas
                                         made it clear that some choices were not feasible or intuitive, and were discarded early in the process.

                                         <p>I drew more detailed sketches of the dashboard to explore the options for different functions,
                                             allowing me to diverge from standard car designs and devise a solution that best fits the drivers’ needs.

                                                 Although a design like in the screen below is geared towards a potential consumer, some information like the state of charge (SOC) 
                                                 may have to be revisualized for greater accuracy, as the electrical measurements may not translate fully into

                                             <h3>Challenges</h3>
                                             <p>Because the car is being built in tandem with the other electrical, mechanical, and firmware teams, the 
                                                 interior could be affected by certain changes made to the initial car plan. Constant team communication and prioritization is key
                                                 to prevent any conflicting designs.

                                             <p>There is still much work to do on the user experience side of the solar car-building process. 
                                                 Some current plans include:<br>

                        <p>* leading the user experience design of the driver interactions (dashboard and center console screen) for the 2020 Midnight Sun solar car, MSXIV<br>

                        <p>my work designing the user experience of midnight sun's 2020 solar car includes running primary research sessions
                            to understand the users, conducting systems analysis and usability testing to determine the best possible 
                            means of fulfilling the users' needs (and safety regulations), and communicating with the electrical and mechanical teams to validate designs.
                            the design process spans the entirety of the car dashboard, but this project is focused on the driver and center console displays.
                            
                        </p><br>

                        <h4><strong>the story</strong></h4>
                        <p>When I interviewed three drivers of the previous solar car, MSXII, about their overall 
                            experiences of driving it, I found out they had common issues relating to the driver display:                         
                            <ul>
                            <li>Lack of feedback/signals from the car made it difficult to troubleshoot when something went wrong</li>
                            <li>The amount of irrelevant graphs and data on the screen obstructed them from seeing what was important to them
                                (speed, state of charge, turn signals)</li>
                            <li>Glare from the sun prevented drivers from reading the screen easily</li>
                        </ul></p>
                        
                           <p>Based on this feedback, the main goals I focused on when designing the new screen were ensuring that the screen was easy to read and only 
                            relevant information was on the driver display, since safety was the most 
                            important factor in the design.
                         </p>

                         <p>I approached the center console screen design in a different way, since a previous design did not exist for it. 
                             I mocked up a quick design for a prototype that would test 
                         </p>
                            <p><a href="https://www.kristenshiozaki.me/" target="_blank">Kristen</a> and I worked together to build the <a href="https://invis.io/43SB4QRUZTY" target="_blank">prototype</a> for the telemetry screen, 
                                which we used in a usability testing session to gain a better understanding of what types of data visualization would be most useful to the drivers/passengers during the competitions—do they need to see 
                                hard numbers, or a graph to show change in a variable over time? 
                            </p>

                            <p>Because many considerations for the design depend on the (incomplete) dashboard height 
                                and seat placement, it will be difficult to test the screen design accurately in the physical mockup. 
                                But for the next iteration, I would like to test the new design with more specific KPIs, including</p>-->
