                    <strong>Duration:</strong> Sep 2018 - present<br>
                    <strong>Role:</strong> Core Mechanical (Interiors) Team Member<br>
                    <strong>The team:</strong> 1 Team lead, 7 Interiors members<br>
                    <strong>Some actions:</strong><br>
                    - Leading the user experience design of the driver interactions (dashboard and center console screen) for the 2020 Midnight Sun solar car, MSXIV<br>
                    - Collaborating with other Electrical and Mechanical members to ensure the validity of designs<br>
                    - Researching possible software and technology to implement to meet the American Solar Challenge qualifications and the team’s design plans</p>

                    <p>I am currently leading the user experience design for the solar car. I keep two goals in mind while designing. 
                        The overall goal for the solar race car is to be as efficient yet consumer-friendly as possible. 
                        The goal for the interior design is to support a driving experience that 
                        is safe, intuitive, and comfortable for drivers and passengers of the car. Because this project is in progress, this page is not yet complete and contains my work and thought processes so far!
                    </p>

                    <h2>THE PROCESS (SO FAR)</h2>
                        <h3>What’s involved?</h3>
                        <p>Before designing anything, the first step was to know what was necessary for the interior following American Solar Challenge regulations. To make sure we included all the components, 
                            we asked about the experiences of drivers and passengers of our previous solar car, MSXII, and used sensory inputs/outputs as a guide to create a morphological chart. 
                            The chart, divided into subsystems and broken down into specific functions, was used to brainstorm all  possible means of satisfying the functions.
                            We narrowed the options to 1-2 for each function after analyzing different combinations and eliminating unviable choices.
                        </p>
 
                        <figure>
                                <img src="img/ms_v3_morph.png">
                                <figcaption>
                                    Section of V3 of the morphological chart.
                                </figcaption>
                             </figure>

                             <p>After narrowing down some solutions, I grouped the components into sections to see 
                                 how they would work together. Sketching and discussing some of these ideas
                                 made it clear that some choices were not feasible or intuitive, and were discarded early in the process.
                             </p>

                            <figure>
                                    <img src="img/int_first.png">

                                 <p>I drew more detailed sketches of the dashboard to explore the options for different functions,
                                     allowing me to diverge from standard car designs and devise a solution that best fits the drivers’ needs.
                                 </p>

                                 <figure>
                                        <img src="img/int_2.png">
                                        <figcaption>
                                            Driver-dashboard interaction ideas.

                                     </figure>

                                     <p>On the digital side, the information on the dashboard screen contents was minimized to display the essential driver information. 
                                         Although a design like in the screen below is geared towards a potential consumer, some information like the state of charge (SOC) 
                                         may have to be revisualized for greater accuracy, as the electrical measurements may not translate fully into 
                                         common visuals.

                                     </p>
                                     
                                 <figure>
                                        <img src="img/int_dash_screen1.png">

                                     <h3>Challenges</h3>
                                     <p>Because the car is being built in tandem with the other electrical, mechanical, and firmware teams, the 
                                         interior could be affected by certain changes made to the initial car plan. Constant team communication and prioritization is key
                                         to prevent any conflicting designs.
                                         

                                     </p>

                                     <h3>Next steps</h3>
                                     
                                     <p>There is still much work to do on the user experience side of the solar car-building process. 
                                         Some current plans include:<br>
                                         
                                        - Creating physical prototypes to test usability of screens/font sizes<br>
                                        - Finalizing software and design with the electrical and firmware teams<br>
                                        - Designing the user interface for the dashboard and center console screens</p>
