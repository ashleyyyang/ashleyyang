                        <h4>driver/center console displays</h4>
                        

                        <p>
                        <strong>project duration:</strong> may 2019 - present<br></p>
                        <p>* Leading the user experience design of the driver interactions (dashboard and center console screen) for the 2020 Midnight Sun solar car, MSXIV.<br>

                        <p>My work designing the user experience of midnight sun's 2020 solar car includes running primary research sessions
                            to understand the users, conducting systems analysis and usability testing to determine the best possible 
                            means of fulfilling the users' needs (and safety regulations), and communicating with the electrical and mechanical teams to validate designs.
                            The design process spans the entirety of the car dashboard, but this project is focused on the driver and center console displays.
                            
                        </p><br>

                        <h4><strong>the story</strong></h4>
                        <p>When I interviewed three drivers of the previous solar car, MSXII, about their overall 
                            experiences of driving it, I found out they had common issues relating to the driver display:                         
                            <ul>
                            <li>Lack of feedback/signals from the car made it difficult to troubleshoot when something went wrong</li>
                            <li>The amount of irrelevant graphs and data on the screen obstructed them from seeing what was important to them
                                (speed, state of charge, turn signals)</li>
                            <li>Glare from the sun prevented drivers from reading the screen easily</li>
                        </ul></p>
                        
                           <p>Based on this feedback, the main goals I focused on when designing the new screen were ensuring that the screen was easy to read and only 
                            relevant information was on the driver display, since safety was the most 
                            important factor in the design.
                         </p>

                                <div class="col-sm-6">
                                    <img src="img/DD_1.png">

                                    <p><strong>An early screen design.</strong> After talking 
                                        to some of the drivers about this design, I discovered some aspects that needed to be changed:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Having the faults on the display (bottom right) was not feasible for electrical reasons, 
                                            and the grouping was confusing for the drivers
                                        </li>
                                        <li>The speed and battery were self-explanatory, and the labels just added visual clutter</li>
                                        <li>The parking brake signal was not intuitive as to what its purpose was (to alert drivers to 
                                            engage the parking brake before shifting to drive mode if they did not)
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                         <p>I was able to gather feedback from the users before testing an initial driver display design in the physical car mockup. 
                             Testing the screen in the car mockup was important as it gave both the designers and the drivers a realistic 
                             idea about the feasibility of each aspect of the design, including data visualization, screen size, and screen location.
                         </p>

                                        <img src="img/driver screen.png">

                                        <p><strong>Screen design used in the first usability testing session.</strong> Following feedback from the users, 
                                        I removed the visual clutter to make the screen minimal but informative at a short glance. The drivers/passengers in the usability session 
                                        mentioned that:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>They would still like to see the number of miles driven</li>
                                            <li>They would like a way to set cruise control easily</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>The design changes for these findings will be applied for the next usability testing session.</p>

                                </div>

                         <p>I approached the center console screen design in a different way, since a previous design did not already exist for it. 
                             
                         </p>

                                    <p><a href="https://www.kristenshiozaki.me/" target="_blank">Kristen</a> and I worked together to build a quick prototype for the telemetry screen, 
                                        which we used in a usability testing session to gain a better understanding of what types of data visualization would be most useful to the drivers/passengers during the competitions—do they need to see 
                                        hard numbers, or a graph to show change in a variable over time? So far, the design has been easy to navigate with a <strong>task completion rate of 100%</strong>.
                                    </p><br>
                                </div>

                            <h4><strong>next steps</strong></h4>
                            <p>Because many considerations for the designs depend on the dashboard height 
                                and seat placement which have not been finalized, it will be difficult to test the screen design accurately in the physical mockup. 
                                But for the next iteration, I would like to test the new designs with more specific KPIs, including the time drivers' eyes are 
                            off the road when completing tasks.</p>
