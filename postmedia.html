                <h4><strong>My experience at Postmedia I/O</strong></h4>
                <p>Working at Postmedia I/O as a UX design intern was my first foray into 
                    design in a work environment! For four months, I worked with the design team to 
                    tailor an analytical marketing dashboard to business owners‚Äô needs‚Äîincluding improving the onboarding 
                    flow, making a more intuitive navigation, and designing a benchmarking feature. I 
                    am really grateful to have learned from my incredible mentor, Lizzie, and 
                    to have applied that theoretical knowledge by conducting usability testing 
                    sessions with clients (my favorite part of designing!). Although I can‚Äôt 
                    share the exact data, details, and designs relating to my work over those 
                    four months, I can talk about some things that I‚Äôve learned!</p>

                <h4><strong>Conducting research sessions</strong></h4>
                <p>I spent most of my time at Postmedia on research sessions. 
                    I learned how to write research plans, develop unbiased 
                    questions from the tasks we wanted to test, create lo-fi 
                    and hi-fi prototypes, and even run several of the 10+ usability 
                    testing sessions myself. In these sessions, I read through the scripts, came 
                    up with probing questions when needed, and read the mood of the participants 
                    to ensure their feelings and situations were always put before the research goal. 
                    Although research is one of the most time-consuming parts of the design process, 
                    it is also the most rewarding, especially because I get to connect directly with 
                    users of the product to gain a better understanding of the situation of concern.</p><br />

                     <h4><strong>Staying on track</strong></h4>
                     <p>The design team works on several projects simultaneously, so I stayed organized by keeping documenting my daily to-do list, questions, and notes. Writing in the log every day reminded me to regularly check the Trello board and my digital calendar to prioritize and look for additional work if I completed my goals for the day.
                            Taking these steps helped me manage smaller tasks and focus on the bigger picture, bringing more quality and depth to team meetings. It also helped me monitor my contributions and growth!

                    <h4><strong>Balancing business, engineering, and design</strong></h4>
                    <p>Working at Postmedia I/O as a UX designer gave me a first look at interacting 
                        with PMs, developers, and directors‚Äîpeople who don‚Äôt necessarily have design 
                        backgrounds or design as their first priority. I‚Äôve realized that designing for 
                        a digital product isn‚Äôt just about creating screens on Sketch, but also about 
                        explaining design findings to guide the product direction, structuring the 
                        information in a way that is relevant to the intended audience. This mindset 
                        includes balancing design with engineering and business timelines. After my time 
                        at Postmedia, I look forward to sharpening my communication skills through interactions 
                        with designers & non-designers alike.</p>

                        <p>My four months at Postmedia shaped the way I currently approach 
                            design‚Äîwith curiosity, excitement, and an open mind. I can‚Äôt wait to 
                            build off the design foundation I gained at Postmedia to tackle more problems 
                            in the future!
                        </p>
