                <h4><strong>my experience at postmedia i/o</strong></h4>
                <p>Working at Postmedia I/O as a UX design co-op was an amazing experience that allowed me to explore
                 and practice the design process. During my 4 months there, I worked with the design team to 
                 continue improving a marketing analytical dashboard that would meet our users‚Äô needs. I am 
                 really grateful to have learned from my incredible mentor, Lizzie, and to have applied that 
                 theoretical knowledge by conducting research sessions with clients (my favorite part of the design 
                 cycle!). Although I can‚Äôt share the exact data, details, and designs relating to my work over those 
                 four months, I can talk about some things that I‚Äôve learned!</p>

                <h4><strong>conducting research sessions</strong></h4>
                <p>The majority of my time at Postmedia went towards preparation with the design team to ensure 
                    the quality of research sessions. I learned how to write research plans, develop unbiased 
                    questions from the tasks we wanted to test, and create lo-fi and hi-fi prototypes. In addition 
                    to taking notes and asking follow-up questions in 10+ research sessions, I practiced my 
                    interview skills with guidance from the design team in 2 usability testing sessions. In these 
                    sessions, I read through the scripts, came up with probing questions when needed, and read the 
                    mood of the participants to ensure their feelings and situations were always put before the 
                    research goal. I hope to continue to grow empathy by determining users‚Äô frustrations and 
                    pinpointing the roots of the problems users encounter. Although research is one of the most
                     time-consuming parts of the design process, I believe it is also the most rewarding, 
                     especially when I connect with users of the product directly and gain a better understanding 
                     of the bigger situation of concern.</p>

                     <h4><strong>staying on track</strong></h4>
                     <p>Because the design team works on several tasks at a time, I wanted to stay organized by knowing 
                     which tasks I completed and which tasks I should work on the next day. I found it helpful to keep 
                     a modified accountability log to document this information in addition to my questions and notes 
                     on design best practices. I also regularly checked the Trello boards and my digital calendar to 
                     prioritize and look for additional work if I completed my goals for the day.</p>

                     </figure>
                     
                    <p>Taking these steps helped me manage smaller tasks and focus on the bigger picture, bringing more 
                    quality and depth to team meetings. It also helped me monitor my personal contributions and progress!</p>

                    <h4><strong>balancing business, engineering, and design</strong></h4>
                    <p>Working at Postmedia I/O as a UX designer gave me a first look at interacting with PMs, 
                        developers, and directors‚Äîpeople who don‚Äôt necessarily have design backgrounds or design 
                        as their first priority. I‚Äôve realized that designing for a digital product isn‚Äôt just 
                        about creating screens on Sketch, but also about explaining design findings to guide the 
                        product direction, structuring the information in a way that is relevant to the intended 
                        audience. This mindset includes balancing design with engineering and business timelines. 
                        After my time at Postmedia, I look forward to sharpening my communication skills through 
                        interactions with designers & non-designers alike.</p>

                    <h4><strong>design is iterative</strong></h4>
                    <p>Even though my professor drilled that fact into my head in my first engineering design 
                        course at UW, I only understood its importance after working with real users and real 
                        consequences at Postmedia. Designs aren‚Äôt perfect the first time. While it would be 
                        efficient to come up with a perfect solution the first time, people are always changing, 
                        and their problems along with them. It‚Äôs impossible to fully understand the multifaceted 
                        nature of a problem in one sitting for all the people it affects. So my goal isn‚Äôt to make 
                        the final design in my first shot, but to make the best design with the research, 
                        resources, and experience that I have. This mindset helps me separate my feelings from 
                        my work and lets others critique it directly so that I can make the right changes without 
                        clouded judgment. Even if designs ‚Äúfail,‚Äù every step helps me better understand the 
                        situation of concern to come up with the most relevant designs.<br><br>
                    Towards the end of my term at Postmedia, I thought about the future of the analytical 
                    dashboard I was helping to build. I realized that what may be the perfect solution now might 
                    not be so as the world changes. This made me think: how can we plan for the future while designing in 
                    the present? I‚Äôm excited to explore this idea in both my Human Factors 
                    in Design and Global Environmental Systems courses during this school term!
